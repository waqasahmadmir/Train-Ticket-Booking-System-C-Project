# Train-Ticket-Booking-System-C-Project
This project is implemented in C++. The project utilizes the concept of binary searching and Bubble sorting along with the implementation of Dijkstra graph, queues and linked list. The Dijkstra algorithm is used to find the shortest path, linked list is used for storing the record of trains and customer along with ticket.
